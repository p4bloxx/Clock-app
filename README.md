## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript
- Quotes generator - [https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction]
- IP Geolocation - [https://docs.ipdata.co/docs]

### What I learned

This challenge was very interesting to build and fun at the same time. It gave me the opportunity to use **2 different APIs**, one to generate **random quotes** and another to get the data of the **timezone** from which the user visiting the page is connected, via address IP. Overall I didn't have many problems, and it was a great workout ;)

### Continued development

I will continue to solve challenges with the use of **APIs** so that I become more comfortable using them for different types of data.
